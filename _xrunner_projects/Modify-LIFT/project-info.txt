# Modify LIFT file for DAB

## Modify trait categoreis

This project is step up to modify the trait element that is not currently showing up in DAB built apps.

It does this by running an XSLT transformation on the source LIFT file.

It can do a number of things.

* Add a note field with a label defined in the project.txt file
* Add some reversal fields to generate a tab at the top like a language tab to provide another index.
  * One reversal is for the semantic category by name
  * The other is for the semantic category by number
* The transformation preserves the original trait element and its attributes.
* All other fields are just copied from the LIFT file.
