This is a shell project that can be sued to make a complete Concordance of any group of USX files exported from Paratext.

This project relies on:
Java (that should be installed with the installation if not before)
Saxon (that was installed with the installation)
PrinceXML that needs to be installed seperately.

In Paratext under Tools /  Advanced /Export USX.

Move the exported USX files into the projects USX folder.

Open the project.txt file in a text editor and edit ther relvant parts:
line 2 title
line 3 iso code
line 5 ptproject put your Paratext project code here.
line 6 subtitle if needed
line 7 max-word-occurance-count this will remove words with more than the specified number of references.
line 8 min-word-length specify the minimum word length to include

line 10 compiler This is generic but can be changed to whatever you want.
line 11 publisher dito
line 12 publication-date

lines 14-19 probably don't need to change.

line 21 booknamessource needs to point to your BookNames.xml in your paratext project.

line 22 include the books you want in the concordance
line 23 usxpath this can be changed if you want to use where you exported the USX fiels too.
line 24 getabbrev specifies the whether yuo want the "abbr" or "short" name found in BookNames.XML. That is found in Paratext's Scripture Reference Settings.

Leave the rest alone.

Now Double click on Xrunner.hta or go to Start / Publishing / Xrunner

Click the top button: 1. Click here to select your project folder
Click on Complete_Concordance_Builder
Click on My-Concordance

You can't edit in the white text box. It is there for reference.

Click the first button in the bottom group: combine usx and group
Then build either the HTML then PDF (PrinceXML must be installed) 
Or generate the Concordance SFM for Paratext or if small maybe in SAB. 
Large concordances do not work in th SAB app, or rather they are too slow.
